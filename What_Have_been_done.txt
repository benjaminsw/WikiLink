Hi

The following thing have been done

1. For the training images received a data annotation have been used. A third party tool have been used for this. Since this tool BBox only works for jpg images a script have been written to convert the images in that format. 
2. The script mentioned in 1 call the pre processin script and then convert all the preprocessed images to corresponding format so that can be used by the tool mentioned in 1.
3. A second script convert the tool mentioned in 1 to YOLO format. The deliverables will contain this script also however main vertion of it is open sourced, This script is bit modified by me for better performance and timing also specific modification have been done for preprocessing constraint.
4. A third script divides the train and test images and generate things needed for GPU training.
5. YOLO configuration file have been cretaed after this.
6. GPU training have been done using darknet and considering subdivision 16 which takes longer time considering my GPU. I ran it till average error is below 1. 
7. Using other image for this case image18 which you have sent I have tested and satisfied with the result after post processing

I have attached the processed output. I will deliver rest of the codes (Will be required if you want to retrained it) and YOLO weight file after the transaction as usual.

Please let me know your feedback on this by tomorrow
